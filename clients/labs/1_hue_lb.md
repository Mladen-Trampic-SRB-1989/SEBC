Hue Load-Balancing , multi instances
======

This is an demo of Load-Balancing two HUE instances, what we are doing is connecting to them through load balancers.
In demo, we will stop one instance of HUE, and we will see from tailing access log, that on that instance
there will be no activities. While we will stil be able to use HUE normally, like nothing happened.
