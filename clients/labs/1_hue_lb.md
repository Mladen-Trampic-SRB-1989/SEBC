Hue Load-Balancing , multi instances
======

This is an demo of two HUE instances, where we are connecting to them through load balancers.
In demo, we will stop one instance of HUE, and we can see from tailing of access log, that on that instance
that there will be no activities. And we will be connecting to same url.
